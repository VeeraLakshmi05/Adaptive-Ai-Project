      "\n",
      "1.  **Triage and Target Key Concepts:** Don't try to learn everything. Quickly scan your syllabus, notes, or textbook headings to identify the most crucial topics, definitions, or formulas. Focus your limited time on understanding the absolute core concepts that are most likely to appear, aiming for a basic grasp rather than deep mastery.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Practice with Past Questions/Summaries:** Instead of reading entire chapters, try to find and work through a few past exam questions or review concise summaries. This active recall is far more efficient for last-minute learning, helping you identify what you *do* know and quickly pinpoint major gaps.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Prioritize Strategic Rest:** While it feels counterintuitive, aim for at least 4-5 hours of sleep tonight. An exhausted brain struggles to recall information or think clearly during the exam. A little rest will make you more effective in the morning and during the test itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Create a Micro-Study Plan:** Break down the remaining hours into very short, focused blocks (e.g., 30-minute bursts). Assign a specific, manageable task to each block, like \"review Chapter 2 summary\" or \"attempt 3 practice problems.\" Stick to this plan to build momentum and avoid feeling completely lost.\n",
